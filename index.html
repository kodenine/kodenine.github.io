            <h5>Team Lead/Architect</h5>
            <p>Managed two product engineering teams. The UX team was focused on improving the user interfaces and user experiences of a number of products that were developed as separate products in separate companies. After being aquired by NAVEX Global these products were declining in sales due to market pressure and competition. With my team's initiative all of the flagship products were redesigned to reflect a common design that presented the unified vision the company had for these products. With the new design these products were back as the number one in the industry and when a third party came to review the products they thought they had been designed by the same company.</p>
            <p>As the UX team lead the team was able to accomplish these outcomes with a style guide and through UX research which were both newly introduced.</p>
            <p>As a team lead of another product development team at the same time. The team was able to deliver on a number of business requirements including a reporting solution, a custom rule engine for notifications and a data export tool.</p>
            <p>Initially developed software solutions as a senior developer working on the flagship product's first web service offering. Was brought in to help finish a number of time sensitive projects that were in danger of not meeting their deadlines. Included adaptive case management feature which was not going to be completed on time before being brought in. After refining the requirements with product management and finding feasible technical solutions to previous roadblocks the ACM project delivered within the deadline.</p>
