          <h5>Team Lead/Architect</h5>
          <p>The last team I managed was focused on improving the UX of a number of products that were developed as separate products in separate companies. These products were declining in sales due to market pressure. With my own team's initiative all of the flagship products were redesigned to reflect a common design that presented the unified vision the company had for these products. With the new design these products were back as the number one in the industry and when a third party came to review the products they thought they had been designed by the same company.
          <p>As the UX team lead the team was able to accomplish these outcomes with a style guide and through UX research which were both newly introduced.</p>
          <p>I was also a team lead for one of our product development teams at the same time. We were able to deliver on a number of business requirements including a reporting solution, a custom rule engine for notifications and data export tool.</p>
          <p>Before I was a team lead I worked as a senior developer. I was able to work on a number of time sensitive projects that were in danger of not meeting their deadlines. This included an adaptive case management feature which in danger of not being completed. With the ACM project I was able to rally the team and deliver within the timeline.</p>
